# 🌟 Scroll Reveal Website – Tutorial Project

This project is a website built by following the [**"You Must-Have This Effect on Your Website"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_p3PvrPxQ&t=1328s) tutorial by **CodeWithSadee** on YouTube. The tutorial focused on using **CSS Grid** and creating a **scroll reveal effect** to animate elements as they enter the viewport.

In addition to following the tutorial, I added my own responsive **navigation bar** and customized the overall design for a more complete layout.
